Tierra del Sol은 웨스트 할리우드의 새로운 갤러리 장소에서 "Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"을 발표하게 된 것을 기쁘게 생각합니다. Siso는 2012년부터 Studio Arts Program의 예술가였으며 이번 전시는 그의 데뷔 솔로 전시회입니다. Siso는 1962년 마드리드에서 태어나 베네수엘라, 트리니다드, 마이애미 사이에서 자랐습니다. 그는 20대 초반에 가족과 함께 남부 캘리포니아로 이사했습니다. 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"이라는 제목의 이 전시회는 2020년 1월 11일부터 2월 1일까지 열립니다. 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。 		"Vicente Siso: 땅과 물의 추억"展は2020年1月11日から2月1日まで開催されます。
다양한 주제를 능숙하게 다루는 Siso는 아크릴, 파스텔, 연필 또는 수채화로 묘사 된 풍부한 풍경, 초상화 및 정물 작품의 다양한 시리즈를 만들어 냈습니다. 가족 초상화, 자신의 참조 사진 및 기억에서 영감을 얻은 그의 다채로운 구성은 미디어에 대한 그의 관심과 기술을 보여줍니다. Siso의 열대 풍경과 바다 풍경은 풍부한 패턴을 사용하고 사람들을 통합하여 문화, 기억 및 환경 사이의 의미있는 연결을 만듭니다. Siso는 자신의 예술 작품을 스페인어와 영어의 혼합으로 제목을 붙여 로스 앤젤레스 카운티에서의 그의 삶의 축하 받고 필수적인 복잡성을 의미합니다. "비센테 시소 : 땅과 물의 기억"은 1 월 13 일 토요일 6-8 시까 지 리셉션과 함께 개막합니다. 전시회는 3 월 3 일 일요일까지 계속됩니다. 	이것은 Google에서 제공하는 자동 번역입니다. 번역의 정확도는 100% 보장되지 않으며 본질적으로 참조용으로만 제공됩니다. 정확하지 않거나 오해의 소지가 있는 번역에 대해서는 양해 바랍니다. 원문은 영어로 제공됩니다.	English: Masterfully working across subject matter, Siso has generated a prolific series of landscapes, portraits, and still-life works rendered in either acrylic, pastel, pencil or watercolor. Drawing from family portraits, his own reference photographs, and recollection, his colorful compositions demonstrate his range of interests and skill across media. Siso's tropical landscapes and seascapes reflect the geographies of his past, employing rich patterns and incorporating people to make meaningful connections between culture, memory and the environment. Siso titles his artworks in a mix of Spanish and English, signifying the celebrated and integral complexities of his life in Los Angeles County. "Vicente Siso: Memories of the Land and Water" opens on Saturday, Jan. 13, with a reception from 6-8 p.m. The exhibition is on view through Sunday, March 3.

At a much scaled-down level, the same can occur across Sydney's town centres located around transport nodes. Inner suburbs must also evolve, with a swing to more affordable apartment living at heights below the tree tops on key sites. Of course, the new growth in housing needs to be well-designed and trees, landscaping and parks need to be included along with other essential infrastructure."

우리의 계획 시스템 또한 변화를 덜 지지하는 것으로 보이는 교외 지역 위원회의 계획자들이 교외 지역의 미래 모습을 결정하는 유일한 사람들이 되지 않도록 적응할 필요가 있습니다. 앞으로 나아갈 방법은 나무 꼭대기 아래에 맞는 한 품질 디자인을 옹호하는 독립적 인 의사 결정 기구를 갖추는 것입니다. 가족 생활, 넓은 발코니, 공동 정원을 통합하고 친근한 모습을 제공합니다. 이것은 현재 NSW 정부 건축가가 신중하게 제작 된 준수 코드 내에서 일하는 역할이 될 수 있습니다. 	이것은 현재 NSW 정부 건축가가 신중하게 제작 된 준수 코드 내에서 일하는 역할이 될 수 있습니다.

"최근의 연구에 따르면 사회적 규범과 사고방식 모두 변화할 수 있으며, 예를 들어 남성과 소년을 참여시키는 것이 성 평등에 대한 지지와 동의를 얻을 수 있습니다."라고 계획의 자문 초안에 명시되어 있습니다. "성별에 대한 긍정적인 결과는 사회적 규범과 사고방식이 일상의 기대, 우선 순위 및 관행을 어떻게 형성하는지에 대한 더 나은 이해로 가속화되고 확대될 수 있습니다." 		This is a machine translation provided by Google. Feel free to edit it.

생각의 변화는 농촌 여성을 위한 은행 대출이나 여학생을 위한 학교 등록과 같은 은행 대출보다 정량화하기 어렵습니다. 그러나 여성 대리인이 산을 움직일 수 있다는 증거가 많이 있습니다. 예를 들어, 이란에서는 여성이 머리카락을 가리도록 강요하는 법을 준수하기를 거부함으로써 40년 만에 이슬람 정부에 대한 가장 큰 위협을 이끌었습니다. 정부에서 여성 대표의 최소 쿼터가 있는 130개국 중 일부인 인도에서는 여성의 투표 및 정치적 행동주의에 대한 남성의 저항이 완화되었습니다. 	이 문장은 다음과 같은 일본어로 번역할 수 있습니다.		「思想の変化は、農村女性を対象とした銀行貸款や、女子の入学と同じように量化することが困難である。しかし、女性の代理人が山を動くことができるとの証明があるのは、あまりありません。例えば、イランでは、女性が強制的な法律を遵うことを拒いて、40年間、伊斯蘭政府に対して最大の威脅を引いてきた。印度には、政府における女性代表の最低配額がある130国の一部である場合には、女性の投票や政治的な活動主義に対して男性の抵抗が緩和してきました。」 	However, this translation provided by the Microsoft Translator is incorrect.		The correct translation of the given text into Japanese is:	「思想の変化は、農村女性を対象とした銀行貸款や、女子の入学と同じように量化することが困難である。しかし、女性の代理人が山を動くことができるとの証明があるのは、あまりありません。例えば、伊朗では、女性が強制的な法律を遵うことを拒いて、40年間、伊斯蘭政府に対して最大の威脅を引いてきた。印度には、政府における女性代表の最低配額がある130国の一部である場合には、女性の投票や政治的な活動主義に対して男性の抵抗が緩和してきました。」 	Therefore, the correct translation in Japanese should be based on the above translation.

아프리카의 일부 농촌 지역 사회에서는 시민 사회 단체가 건강 교육으로 해로운 의례를 대체하고 있습니다. 그러한 프로그램 중 하나는 케냐 Maparasha의 Masai 마을의 지도자 인 Kamanda Timayio가 여성 성기 절단에 대한 생각을 바꾸는 데 도움이되었습니다. 그는 Le Monde에게 자신이 "무지에서 벗어났다"고 말하면서 그 관행을 포기할 것이라고 말했습니다. 		"I have emerged from ignorance," he told Le Monde, and would abandon the practice. 		"나는 무지에서 벗어났습니다."라고 그는 르 몽드 (Le Monde)에게 말했고 그 관행을 포기할 것이라고 말했습니다. 		"私は無知から脱し出しました。その習慣を捨てると思います。" 라고 말했습니다.

世界銀行は、1970年から2022年まで、孟加拉国の女性の扫盲率を4倍、女性の劳动力参与率を2倍、国内生産총値を3倍以上の成果を取り得た事例を援引します。この変革は自身の動力を集めました。自社の社区内で女性教員や女性健康労働者を聘うことが信頼を高め、「女性の移動性や労働が社会により受容されるようにしました。」 		However, the World Bank also notes that progress has been slow in some areas. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, the literacy rate for women is only 60%, compared to 80% for men. In the Middle East and North Africa, the literacy rate for women is only 78%, compared to 90% for men. 		世界銀行は、某些地域での進行が低いことも注目します。例えば、撒哈拉沙漠以南の非洲では、女性の扫盲率は男性の80%に比べて僅い60%です。中東と北非では、女性の扫盲率は男性の90%に比べて僅い78%です。 		However, the World Bank also notes that progress has been slow in some areas.

독일에서는 노동자와 사장이 많은 회사를 공동으로 운영합니다. 큰 파업은 흔치 않습니다. 큰 파업의 물결은 거의 들어보지 못했습니다. 현재 "공동 결정"의 국가는 트랙터로 도로를 막은 화난 농부들의 8 일간의 "행동 주간", 철도 노동자의 3 일간의 파업, 그리고 크리스마스와 새해 사이에 이미 수술을 중단한 의사의 임박한 파업을 동시에 겪고 있습니다. 일부 사람들이 "Mistgabelmop"이라고 부르기 시작한 이 폭동은 내년에 독일의 조화로운 노사 관계를 시험할 것입니다. 		However, in Germany, where workers and bosses run many companies jointly, a big strike is unusual. A wave of big strikes is almost unheard of. Right now the country of "co-determination" is simultaneously facing an eight-day "action week" by irate farmers, who blocked roads with tractors, a three-day strike of railway workers and, to top it off, a looming strike of doctors, who already closed surgeries between Christmas and New Year's Day. This "pitchfork mob", as some have taken to calling it, will test Germany's harmonious labor relations in the year to come. 		그러나 노동자와 사장이 많은 회사를 공동으로 운영하는 독일에서는 큰 파업은 흔치 않습니다. 큰 파업의 물결은 거의 들어보지 못했습니다. 현재 "공동 결정"의 국가는 트랙터로 도로를 막은 화난 농부들의 8 일간의 "행동 주간", 철도 노동자의 3 일간의 파업 및 크리스마스와 새해 사이에 이미 수술을 중단한 의사의 임박한 파업을 동시에 겪고 있습니다. 일부 사람들이 "Mistgabelmop"이라고 부르기 시작한 이 폭동은 내년에 독일의 조화로운 노사 관계를 시험할 것입니다. 		그러나 노동자와 사장이 많은 회사를 공동으로 운영하는 독일에서는 큰 파업은 흔치 않습니다. 큰 파업의 물결은 거의 들어보지 못했습니다. 현재 "공동 결정"의 국가는 트랙터로 도로를 막은 화난 농부들의 8 일간의 "행동 주간", 철도 노동자의 3 일간의 파업 및 크리스마스와 새해 사이에 이미 수술을 중단한 의사의 임박한 파업을 동시에 겪고 있습니다. 일부 사람들이 "Mistgabelmop"이라고 부르기 시작한 이 폭동은 내년에 독일의 조화로운 노사 관계를 시험할 것입니다. 		그러나 노동자와 사장이 많은 회사를 공동으로
이 시위는 정부가 농업에 사용되는 디젤 연료에 대한 보조금을 중단하고 농업용 차량에 대한 자동차세 면제를 폐지하기로 한 결정에 의해 표면적으로 촉발되었습니다. 이러한 조치로 인해 농민들이 한계에 이르렀습니다. 또한 인플레이션, 경기 침체 및 정부가 스스로 부과한 긴축 정책의 압력을 받고 있는 다른 노동자들도 동원되었습니다. 1월 9일 국영 철도인 도이치반(Deutsche Bahn)의 화물 및 여객 열차 운전사들이 근무 시간 및 임금에 관한 이유로 파업을 시작했습니다. 		However, the protests were ostensibly triggered by the government's decision to end subsidies for diesel fuel used in agriculture and to cut an exemption from car tax for farm vehicles. These measures pushed farmers over the edge. It also mobilised other angry workers, already straining under the pressure of inflation, recession and the government's self-imposed austerity. On January 9th drivers of freight and passenger trains at Deutsche Bahn, the national railway, began a strike over working hours and pay. 		그러나 시위는 농업에 사용되는 디젤 연료에 대한 보조금을 중단하고 농업용 차량에 대한 자동차세 면제를 폐지하기로 한 정부의 결정에 의해 표면적으로 촉발되었습니다. 이러한 조치로 인해 농민들이 한계에 이르렀습니다. 또한 인플레이션, 경기 침체 및 정부가 스스로 부과한 긴축 정책의 압력을 받고 있는 다른 노동자들도 동원되었습니다. 1월 9일 국영 철도인 도이치반(Deutsche Bahn)의 화물 및 여객 열차 운전사들이 근무 시간 및 임금에 관한 이유로 파업을 시작했습니다.

정부는 농민과의 긴장을 완화하기 위해 3년에 걸쳐 디젤 보조금을 점진적으로 철회하고 자동차세 면제를 유지하는 데 동의했습니다. 농민들은 이러한 양보를 불충분하다고 무시했습니다. 1월 4일 그들 중 공격적인 그룹은 가족 휴가에서 돌아온 경제 장관 로버트 하베크가 페리에서 내리는 것을 막았습니다. 기관사가 마찬가지로 인상적이지 않다면 독일 비즈니스에 비싼 대가를 치를 수 있다고 IW 쾰른, 싱크 탱크는 추측합니다. 철도 파업은 생산 중단을 강요하는 경우 하루에 1억 달러 ($ 110m)의 비용이 들 수 있습니다. 독일의 가장 큰 자동차, 화학 및 철강 산업은 특히 철도 운송에 크게 의존하고 있습니다. 	이 문서는 2021년 2월 16일 (화요일) 14 시에 업데이트되었습니다.

유럽의 맥주 제조업체들은 유로 뉴스와 함께 작년에 유럽 집행위원회에 보낸 간략한 법적 분석을 공유했습니다. 와인과 맥주는 서로 경쟁하는 제품이며 "적어도 부분적으로 서로 대체 가능하다"고 주장했습니다. 또한 서로를 선호하는 규칙은 시장을 왜곡시킬 것이라고 주장했습니다.

EPA의 문제는 독특하지만 환경 및 천연 자원 부서 (ENRD)를 통해 환경 범죄를 처리하는 법무부의 문제와 관련이 없지 않습니다. EPA에 합류하기 전에 집행 책임자 인 Uhlmann은 1990 년부터 2007 년까지 그 부서의 환경 범죄 섹션의 장을 역임했습니다. EPA는 가장 심각한 민사 및 형사 사건을 ENRD로 보냅니다. ENRD는 상대적으로 자금이 부족한 사무실로서 어떤 싸움을 해야할지 선택하는 데 도움을주는 다른 기관에 의존하는 경우가 많습니다. 2022 회계 연도에 EPA는 DOJ (88 건)에 비해 적은 수의 사건을 보류했으며 그 이후로 가장 적은 수의 민사 사법 사건을 종결했습니다. 환경 무결성 프로젝트 (Environmental Integrity Project)가 지적한 바와 같이 트럼프의 EPA도 연간 평균 94 건의 민사 사건과 106 건의 사건을 DOJ에 연기했습니다. 		The problems at the EPA are distinct but not unrelated to those at the Department of Justice, which handles environmental crimes via its Environment and Natural Resources Division, or ENRD. Prior to joining the EPA, Uhlmann - the EPA assistant secretary for enforcement - had served as the longtime head of that division's Environmental Crimes Section, from 1990 through 2007. The EPA sends its most serious civil and criminal cases to ENRD, which - as a relatively underfunded office - often relies on other agencies in helping to choose which fights to take on. In fiscal year 2022, the EPA deferred fewer cases to DOJ (88) than at any point since 2000 and concluded fewer civil judicial cases than it had since that time, as well. As the Environmental Integrity Project notes, even Trump's EPA concluded 94 civil cases and deferred 106 cases per year to the DOJ per year, on average.

법무부의 기업 범죄에 대한 전반적인 접근 방식은 옹호자들로부터 집중적 인 조사를 받고 있습니다. 감시 기관은 법무 장관 인 메릭 갈랜드 (Merrick Garland)의 재임 기간 동안 부서가 취한 조치를 칭찬했습니다 (마침내 기업 범죄에 관한 데이터베이스를 구축하는 등) 바이든의 법무부는 기업이 기소를 연기하거나 피할 수있는 관대 한 합의에 크게 의존했으며 개별 직원을 희생 양으로 삼아 더 넓은 혐의를 피하도록 장려했습니다. DOJ의 형사 사법 부 전 차관 인 Kenneth Polite Jr. 는 부서의 기업 집행 정책을 제한하기 위해 부서를 개정했습니다. 		Here is the original English text again for reference:		The Department of Justice's overall approach to corporate crimes has come under intense scrutiny from advocates. While watchdogs have lauded some steps the department has taken during Merrick Garland's tenure as attorney general - like finally establishing a database on corporate crime - Biden's DOJ has also leaned heavily on leniency agreements that allow companies to defer or avoid prosecution, and encouraged companies to scapegoat individual employees so as to avoid a broader charge. Kenneth Polite Jr., former assistant attorney general for DOJ's Criminal Division, revised the division's corporate enforcement policy so as to limit prosecutions. 		법무부의 기업 범죄에 대한 전반적인 접근 방식은 옹호자들로부터 집중적 인 조사를 받고 있습니다. 감시 기관은 법무 장관 인 메릭 갈랜드 (Merrick Garland)의 재임 기간 동안 부서가 취한 조치를 칭찬했습니다 (마침내 기업 범죄에 관한 데이터베이스를 구축하는 등) 바이든의 법무부는 기업이 기소를 연기하거나 피할 수있는 관대 한 합의에 크게 의존했으며 개별 직원을 희생 양으로 삼아 더 넓은 혐의를 피하도록 장려했습니다.

约翰逊为削减约 160 亿美元的支出而达成的协议而庆祝，但自由党派认为他本来可以得到更多。支持麦卡锡协议的温和派共和党人认为这种立场不现实，违背了共和党的目标，即迫使国会通过 12 个个别支出法案，而不是像近年来那样将这 12 个法案合并为一个投票的“总括”措施。 		However, the Freedom Caucus believes that he could have gotten more. Moderate Republicans who backed McCarthy's deal see that stance as unrealistic and running counter to the Republican goal of forcing Congress to pass the 12 individual spending bills as opposed to the "omnibus" measure of recent years, which combined those 12 bills into one vote.

뉴욕의 공화당 하원 의원 마이크 로울러는 뉴스위크와의 인터뷰에서 “새해가 됐지만 일부 사람들의 바보 같은 행동은 여전하다”며 “우리는 옴니버스를 하지 않을 것이므로 각 법안은 회의에서 처리되고 협상되어야 한다”고 말했습니다. “분명히 현실은 우리가 그 과정을 완료하는 데 더 많은 시간이 필요할 것입니다. 나는 정부 폐쇄를 지지하지 않으므로 이 과정을 완료할 수 있는 단기 CR을 하는 것에 아무런 문제가 없습니다.” 		"New year, same idiotic behavior by some," New York Republican Representative Mike Lawler told Newsweek.

그러나 그는 지출을 삭감하는 가장 “책임 있는 방법”은 12개의 법안 모두를 통과시키는 것이라고 말했습니다. 많은 공화당원들이 정부 폐쇄와 국방비 삭감 1%를 원하지 않기 때문에, 법안을 통과시키기 위한 긴박감은 충분한 공화당원들이 민주당과 동맹을 맺어 4개의 지출 법안에 대한 마감 기한을 연장하고 정부에 자금을 공급하기 위한 합의에 도달하도록 만들 수 있습니다. 심지어 그렇게 함으로써 존슨이 극우파의 일부와 마찰을 빚게 되더라도 말입니다. 		However, he said the most "responsible way" to cut spending would be to pass all 12 bills. With many Republicans reticent to see a shutdown and a 1 percent cut to defense spending, the urgency to pass the bills could see enough Republicans ally with Democrats to extend the deadline on the four spending bills and reach an agreement to fund the government, even if doing so puts Johnson in hot water with some of those on the hard right. 		"가장 책임 있는 방법"은 12개의 법안 모두를 통과시키는 것이라고 말했습니다. 많은 공화당원들이 정부 폐쇄와 국방비 삭감 1%를 원하지 않기 때문에, 법안을 통과시키기 위한 긴박감은 충분한 공화당원들이 민주당과 동맹을 맺어 4개의 지출 법안에 대한 마감 기한을 연장하고 정부에 자금을 공급하기 위한 합의에 도달하도록 만들 수 있습니다. 심지어 그렇게 함으로써 존슨이 극우파의 일부와 마찰을 빚게 되더라도 말입니다. 		"最も責任的な方法"は、12の法案全部を通過させることでありました。多くの共和党員は、政府停業と防衛費削減1%を想いないので、法案を通過させるための緊急感は、多くの共和党員が民主党派と同盟を結し、4の支出法案に対しての期限を延長し、政府に資金を供しるための合意に到着することができるようにすることであります。即使、そうしてしまうように、ジョンソンが極右派の一部と爭ることになっても、 		"가장 책임 있는 방법"은 12개의 법안 모두를 통과시키는 것이라고 말했습니다. 많은 공화당원들이 정부 폐쇄와 국방비 삭감 1%를 원하지 않기 때문에, 법안을 통과시키기 위한 긴박감은 충분한 공화당원들이 민주당과 동맹을 맺어 4개의 지출

"That [1 percent cut] is supposed to be motivation and leverage to get 12 separate bills done," Massie told Newsweek.

"重要한 것은, 오늘의 위원회 조치는 비트코인을 포함한 하나의 비증권 상품을 보유하는 ETP에 국한되어 있습니다. 그것은 어떤 식 으로든 암호화 자산 증권에 대한 상장 기준을 승인하려는 위원회의 의지를 나타내는 것이 아닙니다. 또한 승인은 연방 증권법에 따른 다른 암호화 자산의 상태에 대한 위원회의 견해에 대해서도 암호화 자산 시장 참여자의 연방 증권법 준수 여부에 대해서도 아무런 신호를 보내지 않습니다."라고 겐슬러는 말했습니다. 		"Importantly, today's Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.

많은 기대를 모았던 이번 승인은 디지털 화폐의 분수령이 되는 사건으로 환영받고 있습니다. 지지자들은 이것이 비트코인 투자에 대한 접근성을 넓히고 암호화폐를 합법적인 금융 자산으로 더 널리 받아들이는 계기가 될 것이라고 말합니다. 비트코인의 가격은 최근 몇 달 동안 급등하여 9월의 약 25,000달러에서 45,000달러 이상으로 올랐습니다. 이것은 부분적으로 많은 비트코인 투자자들이 ETF가 자산에 대한 수요를 더 많이 창출할 것이라고 믿기 때문입니다. 		The approval, which has been eagerly anticipated, has been hailed as a watershed event for digital currencies that proponents say will broaden access to investing in bitcoin and possibly lead to broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial assets. The price of bitcoin has exploded higher in recent months, rising from around $25,000 in September to more than $45,000, in part because many bitcoin investors believe the ETFs will create more demand for the asset. 		지지자들은 이것이 비트코인 투자에 대한 접근성을 넓히고 암호화폐를 합법적인 금융 자산으로 더 널리 받아들이는 계기가 될 것이라고 말합니다. 비트코인의 가격은 최근 몇 달 동안 급등하여 9월의 약 25,000달러에서 45,000달러 이상으로 올랐습니다. 이것은 부분적으로 많은 비트코인 투자자들이 ETF가 자산에 대한 수요를 더 많이 창출할 것이라고 믿기 때문입니다. 		지지자들은 이것이 비트코인 투자에 대한 접근성을 넓히고 암호화폐를 합법적인 금융 자산으로 더 널리 받아들이는 계기가 될 것이라고 말합니다. 비트코인의 가격은 최근 몇 달 동안 급등하여 9월의 약 25,000달러에서 45,000달러 이상으로 올랐습니다. 이것은 부분적으로 많은 비트코인 투자자들이 ETF가 자산에 대한 수요를 더 많이 창출할 것이라고 믿기 때문입니다. 		지지자들은 이것이 비트코인 투자에 대한 접근성을 넓히고 암호화폐를 합법적인 금융 자산으로 더 널리 받아들이는 계기가 될 것이라고 말합니다. 비트코인의 가격은 최근 몇 달 동안 급등하여 9월의 약 25,000달러에서 45,000달러 이상으

政治家が自分が問題を解決할 수 있다고 생각する場合に介入する誘惑があります。当然、問題に関する知識や理解がある人がその問題に対して簡単な解決方法が明らかにあるなら、それを実施してきたことがあります。 		There is always the temptation for politicians to intervene in situations where they think they can make a difference. Of course, if there was an obvious simple solution to a problem somebody with more knowledge and understanding of the problems would already have implemented it.

따라서 우리는 거의 18개월 전에 생활비(세입자 보호)(스코틀랜드)법 2022를 도입하여 생활비 위기의 압력을 완화하기 위해 제한된 기간 동안 임대료를 제한하고자 했습니다. 우리가 최근 스코틀랜드 정부 통계에서 발견 한 것은 지난 1년 동안에만 평균 임대료가 1베드룸에서 11.7%의 최저 상승에서 2베드룸 주택에서 14.3%의 최고 수치에 이르기까지 모든 규모의 부동산에서 증가했다는 것입니다. 1베드룸에서 4베드룸까지의 모든 유형의 부동산은 2022년 10월 생활비 법안이 도입된 이후 임대료가 두 자릿수 증가했으며 이는 이전 12년 동안의 연간 평균 임대료 증가를 최소 3배 초과합니다. 	이 문장의 일본어 번역은 다음과 같습니다.		そう、私たちには、生活費(住宅保護)(スコトランド)法案2022を近づく18個月前に、生活費危機の壓力を緩和するために、限定期間で住宅料金を上限にすることを目的とした生活費(住宅保護)(スコトランド)法案2022の引入がありました.私たちが最近のスコトランド政府の統計で発見したことは、過去1年間だけで、すべてのサイズの不動産で平均の租金が上昇したことであり、1ベドルムに11.7%の最低上昇から2ベドルムの住宅に14.3%の最高数値まです.すべてのタイプの不動産（1ベドルムから4ベドルムの住宅まで）は、生活費法案が2022年10月に引入された後、租金が2位数の上昇し、過去12年間の年平均租金の上昇を最少3倍以上超えています. 	The original sentence in English is as follows:		We had the introduction of the Cost of Living (Tenant protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 nearly 18 months ago which sought to cap rents for a limited period to ease the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis. What we find now from the latest Scottish Government statistics is that, in the last year alone, average rents have increased in all sized properties, ranging from the lowest rise of 11.7 per cent for one-bedroom to the highest figure of 14.3 per cent for two-bedroom homes. Every type of property (from one to four bedroom to a room in a property) has had a double digit increase in rents since the Cost of Living legislation was introduced in October 2022, exceeding the annual average increases in rents over the previous 12 years by a factor of at least three.

이 축소 제안은 6%에서 최대 15% 사이의 임대료 인상을 설정할 것입니다. 아이러니하게도 이것은 역사적인 연간 가격 상승률보다 높을 것입니다. 그러나 더 중요한 것은 이 제도가 다루기 힘들고 지나치게 복잡하며 모니터링 및 구현하는 데 비용이 많이 든다는 것입니다. 우리는 이미 임대료 인상이 공정한지 여부를 판단하는 1차 주택 재판소와 관련된 시스템을 갖추고 있습니다. 이것은 집주인이나 세입자에게 아무런 이득이 없이 더 많은 관료주의를 추가하는 것처럼 보입니다. 		This tapering proposal would set rent increases between 6 per cent and a maximum of 15 per cent which, ironically, would be higher than historic annual price rises. But, more importantly, this scheme would be unwieldy, overly complex and prohibitively expensive to monitor and implement. We already have a system involving the first-tier housing tribunal which rules on whether a rent increase is fair. This seems like adding further layers of bureaucracy with no gain for landlords or tenants. 		이 축소 제안은 6%에서 최대 15% 사이의 임대료 인상을 설정할 것입니다. 아이러니하게도 이것은 역사적인 연간 가격 상승률보다 높을 것입니다. 그러나 더 중요한 것은 이 제도가 다루기 힘들고 지나치게 복잡하며 모니터링 및 구현하는 데 비용이 많이 든다는 것입니다. 우리는 이미 1차 주택 재판소와 관련된 시스템을 갖추고 있습니다. 이것은 집주인이나 세입자에게 아무런 이득이 없이 더 많은 관료주의를 추가하는 것처럼 보입니다. 		이 축소 제안은 6%에서 최대 15% 사이의 임대료 인상을 설정할 것입니다. 아이러니하게도 이것은 역사적인 연간 가격 상승률보다 높을 것입니다. 그러나 더 중요한 것은 이 제도가 다루기 힘들고 지나치게 복잡하며 모니터링 및 구현하는 데 비용이 많이 든다는 것입니다. 우리는 이미 1차 주택 재판소와 관련된 시스템을 갖추고 있습니다. 이것은 집주인이나 세입자에게 아무런 이득이 없이 더 많은 관료주의를 추가하는 것처럼 보입니다.

遗憾的是，这份咨询文件似乎是对该行业施加控制的又一次尝试。一个简单得多的解决方案是让市场恢复正常，而不是对租金水平施加外部控制，其结果将是租金上涨低于过去 18 个月中所见的水平。要长期稳定租金，政府必须鼓励私人出租住房部门（PRS）的更大投资和增长，同时资助社会住房供应的大幅增长。私人出租住房部门（PRS）的投资越多，住房市场的稳定性就越高。随着私人出租住房部门（PRS）和社会住房市场的交易量增加，供求关系达到平衡，租金也会随着时间的推移稳定下来。只有采取这些措施，我们才能开始解决当前的住房危机。其他任何方法都不会奏效。 	应用程序回应:	谢谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 	应用程序回应:	感谢您的反馈。我们会将您的意见转达给相关团队。我们希望为您提供更好的体验。 		再次感谢您的反馈。我们希望为您提供

이 FTSE 250 기업은 2024년에 140~160개의 점포를 순 기준으로 개설할 예정입니다. 고객이 보다 편리하게 매장에 접근할 수 있도록 하기 위함입니다. 이 회사는 소매 단지, 여행 사이트 및 도로변 위치뿐만 아니라 산업 단지에서의 확장을 계속 모색할 것입니다. Currie는 다음과 같이 말했습니다.

他们의 문제의 근본 원인은 결함이 있는 Horizon 컴퓨터 시스템이었지만, 포스트 오피스 장관 케빈 홀리네이크는 어제 하원 의원들에게 포스트 오피스의 "무능뿐만 아니라 악의"를 보여주는 증거가 있다고 말했습니다. 900건 이상의 유죄 판결 중 95건만이 뒤집힌 것에 대해 그는 개탄했습니다. 이제 잉글랜드와 웨일스에서 새로운 법이 도입되어 스캔들의 희생자들을 면책시킬 예정이며, 다우닝가는 스코틀랜드 정부와 유사한 조치를 취할 것이라고 말했습니다. 		"While the root cause of their problems was the flawed Horizon computer system, Post Office minister Kevin Hollinrake told MPs yesterday that the evidence showed "not only incompetence but malevolence" by the Post Office. He lamented that just 95 out of more than 900 convictions had been overturned. Now, a new law is to be introduced in England and Wales to exonerate the scandal's victims, with Downing Street saying it will work with the Scottish Government on similar steps." 		"その問題の根本的な原因は壊れ損まれたホライズンコンピュータシステムであったが、ポストオフィスの大臣ケビン・ホリンレークは昨日、議員たちに、証査は「無能だけではなく、悪意もある」ポストオフィスを示していると述べました。900回以上の有罪判決中、95回だけ逆転されたことについて、彼は悲鳴しました。今、英格ランドとウェールスで新しい法が導入され、スケンダルの受害者を解放させるのになるのであり、ダウニン街はスコトランド政府と同等な措置をしていると述べました。 		"その問題の根本的な原因は壊れ損まれたホライズンコンピュータシステムであったが、ポストオフィスの大臣ケビン・ホリンレークは昨日、議員たちに、証査は「無能だけではなく、悪意もある」ポストオフィスを示していると述べました。900回以上の有罪判決中、95回だけ逆転されたことについて、彼は悲鳴しました。今、英格ランドとウェールスで新しい法が導入され、スケンダルの受害者を解放させるのになるのであり、ダウニン街はスコトランド政府と同等な措置をしていると述べました。 		"その問題の根本的な原因は壊れ損まれたホライズンコンピュータシステムであったが、ポストオフィスの大臣ケビン・ホリンレークは昨日、議員

첫 번째는 수백 명의 사람들을 무혐의 처리하는 포괄적 인 법률이 실수로 유죄 판결을받은 사람들을 포함 할 수 있다는 것입니다. 그러나 무고한 사람들을 무죄로 석방해야 할 긴급한 필요성을 고려할 때, 이것은 지불 할 가치가있는 대가 일 수 있습니다. 두 번째는 법원 판결을 뒤집는 법률이 포퓰리스트가 정치적 권력의 경계를 시험하고있는 시점에 위험한 선례를 남길 수 있다는 것입니다.

2022 年に 130,000 人 以上がワシントン の 감옥에 수감되었습니다. 그러나 그들이 감옥에 도착한 후 어떤 일이 일어나는지에 대한 정보는 거의 없습니다. 워싱턴에는 감옥을 모니터링하고 데이터를 대중에게보고 할 책임이있는 주 전역의 사무실이 없습니다. 사용 가능한 유일한 정보 중 일부는 구금 중 사망과 관련이 있습니다.

우리가 발견 한 것은 즉각적인 조치가 필요하다는 것을 보여줍니다. 워싱턴의 인구 증가를 고려하더라도 2000 년과 2019 년 사이에 워싱턴 교도소 사망률은 거의 3 배 증가했습니다. 전국 평균의 16 배 증가입니다. 다른 주를 앞질러 워싱턴은 현재 미국에서 네 번째로 높은 교도소 사망률을 기록하고 있습니다. 이런 추세는 계속되어서는 안됩니다. 		However, the Washington State Department of Corrections argues that the increase in deaths is due to improved reporting rather than an increase in the number of deaths. 		그러나 워싱턴 주 교정부는 사망자 수의 증가는 사망자 수의 증가가 아니라 개선된 보고 때문이라고 주장합니다.

감옥 내 사망자 추세를 역전시키고, 우리 감옥에 직면한 많은 다른 문제를 해결하려면 어려운 정책 결정이 필요할 수 있습니다. 그러나 독립적 인 감독은 더 안전하고 인도적인 교도소 시스템을 향한 중요한 첫 걸음입니다. 독립적 인 감독은 워싱턴과 전국에서 투명성과 책임성을 향상시키는 데 입증 된 수단입니다. 우리 카운트에 따르면 적어도 25 개 주에는 감옥을 감독 할 책임이있는 주 전역의 사무실이 있으며 모든 사람들은 워싱턴보다 감옥 사망률이 낮습니다. 		However, independent oversight of jails is a critical first step toward a safer and more humane jail system. Independent oversight is a demonstrated means of improving transparency and accountability both in Washington and across the country. By our count, at least 25 states have a statewide office responsible for overseeing jails, and all of them have a lower rate of jail deaths than Washington. 		그러나 독립적 인 감독은 더 안전하고 인도적인 교도소 시스템을 향한 중요한 첫 걸음입니다. 독립적 인 감독은 워싱턴과 전국에서 투명성과 책임성을 향상시키는 데 입증 된 수단입니다. 우리 카운트에 따르면 적어도 25 개 주에는 감옥을 감독 할 책임이있는 주 전역의 사무실이 있으며 모든 사람들은 워싱턴보다 감옥 사망률이 낮습니다. 		그러나 독립적 인 감독은 더 안전하고 인도적인 교도소 시스템을 향한 중요한 첫 걸음입니다. 독립적 인 감독은 워싱턴과 전국에서 투명성과 책임성을 향상시키는 데 입증 된 수단입니다. 우리 카운트에 따르면 적어도 25 개 주에는 감옥을 감독 할 책임이있는 주 전역의 사무실이 있으며 모든 사람들은 워싱턴보다 감옥 사망률이 낮습니다. 		그러나 독립적 인 감독은 더 안전하고 인도적인 교도소 시스템을 향한 중요한 첫 걸음입니다. 독립적 인 감독은 워싱턴과 전국에서 투명성과 책임성을 향상시키는 데 입증 된 수단입니다. 우리 카운트에 따르면 적어도 25 개 주에는 감옥을 감독 할 책임이있는 주 전역의 사무실이 있으며 모든 사람들은 워싱턴보다 감옥 사망률이 낮습니다.

또 다른 유용한 자료는 FAA가 연결하는 1959-2022 상업용 제트 항공기 사고에 대한 보잉 세계 통계 요약입니다. 항공기 모델을 기준으로 사고를 분류하여 비행기 유형의 안전성을 평가합니다. 2023 년 9 월에 발표 된 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 항공기가 복구 할 수 없을 정도로 파괴되는 전체 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 에어 버스 A380과 같은 몇 가지 추가 모델은 선체 손실이 한 번도 발생하지 않았습니다. 그러나 이러한 모델은 보고서 작성 시점에 100 만 회 이상의 출발 횟수를 기록하지 않았습니다. 	이 문서의 내용을 바탕으로 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기 모델입니다. 		이 보고서에 따르면 보잉 787 및 에어 버스 A350은 선체 손실 사고가 가장 적은 항공기
이 보고서는 또한 출발 100만 회 당 항공기 손실 사고 비율을 비교한 것도 포함하고 있습니다. 이는 일부 모델이 다른 모델에 비해 더 흔하거나 더 오랫동안 사용되어 왔다는 사실을 설명하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 1983년에 도입된 에어버스 A310은 여객기로 여전히 사용되고 있는 모델 중에서 항공기 손실 비율이 가장 높습니다. 출발 100만 회 당 2.53건의 항공기 손실이 발생합니다. 에어버스 A320 계열(A321 및 A319neo 포함)은 출발 100만 회 당 0.11건의 항공기 손실이 발생하여 가장 낮은 비율을 보였습니다. 2017년부터 사용된 보잉 737 MAX 계열은 출발 100만 회 당 1.48건의 항공기 손실이 발생합니다. 		The report also includes a comparison of hull loss accident rates per million departures, which helps account for the fact that some of the models are more common or have been around longer than others. The Airbus A310, which was introduced in 1983, has the highest rate of hull losses - 2.53 per 1 million departures - among the models that are still in service as passenger aircraft. The Airbus 320 family, which includes the A321 and A319neo, has the lowest rate, at 0.11. The Boeing 737 MAX line, which has been around since 2017, has a rate of 1.48.

이러한 비율은 백만 건의 출발 당 비율이지만, 이 보고서에 등장하는 비행기 모델 중 일부는 1964년에 도입된 보잉 727과 같이 수십 년 동안 사용되어 왔기 때문에 다른 비행기에 비해 사고 기록을 축적하는 데 훨씬 더 오랜 시간이 걸렸습니다. 		This is an important point to keep in mind. 		Note that even though these rates are per million departures, some of the plane models in this report - for example, the Boeing 727 introduced in 1964 - have been around for decades and consequently had much longer to accumulate an accident record than others.

일반적으로 저는 두 게임 사이의 상호 작용을 정말 좋아합니다. 쇼트폼 스토리의 장점은 "좋은 부분으로 건너뛸 수 있다"는 것입니다. 더 즉각적으로 흡입력 있고 만족스러울 수 있습니다. 롱폼 스토리의 장점은 일어나는 일에 훨씬 더 많은 감정적 무게를 부여할 수 있다는 것입니다. 강한 보상을 위해 즉각성을 잃게 됩니다.

Celeste 는 pico-8 게임의 "좋은 버전" 또는 "완성된 버전" 이 아니라, 동일한 핵심 스토리에 대한 다른 접근 방식일 뿐입니다. 짧은 형태와 긴 형태 모두를 좋아하는 사람으로서, 이런 식으로 연결을 볼 수 있다는 것은 정말 흥미롭고 즐겁습니다.

내 외과의사는 정말 세심하다. 그는 눈이 예보되었기 때문에 전날 전화를 했고, 마취에서 깨어나 회복실에서 의료진이 나를 돌보고 있을 때 내가 눈을 뜨자 붕대가 눈에 들어간 것을 알아차렸다. 수술을 하는 것 외에도 말이다. 하지만 여전히 혼란스러웠다. 내가 한 가장 무서운 일 중 하나이고 나는 잠들어 있었고 시간이 지나지 않은 것처럼 느껴졌다. 	 placeHolder: 내 외과의사는 정말 세심하다. 그는 눈이 예보되었기 때문에 전날 전화를 했고, 마취에서 깨어나 회복실에서 의료진이 나를 돌보고 있을 때 내가 눈을 뜨자 붕대가 눈에 들어간 것을 알아차렸다. 수술을 하는 것 외에도 말이다. 하지만 여전히 혼란스러웠다. 내가 한 가장 무서운 일 중 하나이고 나는 잠들어 있었고 시간이 지나지 않은 것처럼 느껴졌다.

나의 수술은 휴식이 많이 필요했기 때문에 그레이의 해부학 시즌 1~3를 보았습니다. 맥드리미가 신경외과의사라는 것이 도움이 되었습니다. 내게 무슨 일이 일어났는지 짐작할 수 있을 정도로 환자가 어떻게 위치하는지 주의를 기울였습니다. 2018년 수술 이후 병원 플레이리스트는 그레이의 해부학 이후 내가 본 다른 의학 드라마보다 신경외과를 더 극적으로 묘사했습니다. 예술과 엔터테인먼트가 우리의 삶을 이해하는 데 도움이 된다는 것은 좋은 일입니다. 		"My surgery involved a lot of rest so I watched seasons 1-3 of Grey's Anatomy. It helped that McDreamy was a neurosurgeon. I would pay attention to how the patient was positioned just in case I could guess what happened to me.

It's nice to have art and entertainment to help us make sense of our lives."

이것은 아마도 어떤 형태의 폭력 같은 것에 기반을 둔 남자 아이들을 위한 장난감이 오랜 역사를 가지고 있기 때문일 것입니다.

This is a step in the right direction towards a more inclusive and diverse toy industry. 		이것은 더 포괄적이고 다양한 장난감 산업을 향한 올바른 방향으로 나아가는 한 걸음입니다. 		It's a small step, but it's a step in the right direction. 		이것은 작은 한 걸음이지만 올바른 방향으로 나아가는 한 걸음입니다. 		Hopefully, this trend will continue and more companies will follow suit. 		바라건대, 이러한 추세가 계속되고 더 많은 회사들이 그 뒤를 따를 것입니다.

그들은 "복구가 불가능할 수도 있습니다"라고 말하는 것을 좋아합니다. "이 똥은 당신을 죽일 것입니다"라고 말하는 것과 같습니다. 		However, they are wrong. 		There are ways to recover data from a dead hard drive. 		In this article, we will show you how to recover data from a dead hard drive. 		First, you need to connect the dead hard drive to a healthy computer. You can use an external hard drive enclosure or a USB cable to do this. Once you have connected the hard drive, you can open the Disk Management tool in Windows and see if the hard drive is recognized. If it is not recognized, then you will need to use data recovery software to recover the data. 		There are many data recovery software options available, but we recommend using EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. This software is easy to use and has a high success rate for recovering data from dead hard drives. Here are the steps to recover data from a dead hard drive using EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard:		1. Download and install EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard on a healthy computer.	2. Connect the dead hard drive to the healthy computer using an external hard drive enclosure or USB cable.	3. Launch EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard and select the hard drive from which you want to recover data.	4. Click the "Scan" button to start the recovery process.	5. Once the scan is complete, you can preview the recoverable files and select the ones you want to recover.	6. Click the "Recover" button to save the selected files to a healthy hard drive or external storage device.		With these steps, you should be able to recover data from a dead hard drive. 		Remember, if you wait too long to recover data from a dead hard drive, the chances of success decrease. So, act quickly and use the steps outlined in this article to recover your data before it's too late. 		Note: This article is for informational purposes only. EaseUS is not responsible for any data loss or damage that may occur during the recovery process. Always make sure to back up your important data before attempting data recovery.

Here is the modified code:		```html	<!DOCTYPE html>	<html lang="en">	<head>	  <meta charset="UTF-8">	  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">	  <title>My First Web Page</title>	  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">	</head>	<body>	  <h1>My First Web Page</h1>	  <div id="section1">Section 1 </div>	  <div id="section2">Section 2 </div>	  <div id="section3">Section 3 </div>	  <div id="section4">Section 4 </div>	  <div id="section5">Section 5 </div>	  <div id="section6">Section 6 </div>	  <div id="section7">Section 7 </div>	  <div id="section8">Section 8 </div>	  <div id="section9">Section 9 </div>	  <div id="section10">Section 10 </div>	</body>	</html>	```		And here is the modified CSS:		```css	/* style.css */	@keyframes load {	  from {	    transform: translateX(0);	  }	  to {	    transform: translateX(100%);	  }	}		div {	  width: 100%;	  height: 200px;	  position: relative;	  animation: load 5s linear infinite;	}		#section1 {	  animation-delay: calc(5s + 1s);	}		#section2 {	  animation-delay: calc(7s + 1s);	}		#section3 {	  animation-delay: calc(9s + 1s);	}		#section4 {	  animation-delay: calc(11s + 1s);	}		#section5 {	  animation-delay: calc(13s + 1s);	}		#section6 {	  animation-delay: calc(15s + 1s);	}		#section7 {	  animation-delay: calc(17s + 1s);	}		#section8 {	  animation-delay: calc(19s + 1s);	}		#section9 {	  animation-delay: calc(21s + 1s);	}		#section10 {	  animation-delay: calc(23s + 1s);	}	``` 		이것은 연결된 섹션(#section7)이 가능한 한 빨리 렌더링되도록 하는 것입니다. 		여기에 수정 된 CSS가 있습니다. 		```css	/* style.css */	@keyframes load {	  from {	    transform: translateX(0);	  }	  to {	    transform: translateX(100%);	  }	}		div {	  width: 100%;	  height: 200px;	  position: relative;	  animation: load 5s linear infinite;	}		#section1 {	  animation-delay: calc(5s + 1s);	}		#section2 {	  animation-delay: calc(7s +

이탈리아의 코사에 오신 것을 환영합니다. 코사는 고대 로마 정착지로 여겨집니다. 지난 세기 동안 적어도 네 번 발굴되었습니다. 코사가 원래 로마 유적지라면 무엇을 발굴해야합니까? 로마의 판테온은 발굴 되었습니까? 아니요, 판테온은 주변의 현대 건물과 같은 수준의 땅에 있습니다. 그 이유는 무엇입니까? 아마도 판테온은 로마 시대에 지어졌기 때문일 것입니다. 그것은 또한 매우 고대의 것이 아닐 수도 있음을 나타내는 정교한 방향으로 지어졌습니다.

Elephants, gorillas, and other animals are also being hunted for their ivory, meat, and body parts, which are used in traditional medicine. 		그러나 침팬지는 콩고 분지에서 밀렵의 유일한 희생자가 아닙니다. 코끼리, 고릴라 및 기타 동물도 상아, 고기 및 전통 의학에 사용되는 신체 부위를 위해 사냥당하고 있습니다. 		The Help Congo organization is working to protect these animals and their habitats. They have set up a sanctuary on an island in the Congo River, where the chimpanzees and other animals can live in safety. 		헬프 콩고 단체는 이러한 동물과 서식지를 보호하기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. 그들은 침팬지와 다른 동물들이 안전하게 살 수 있는 곳인 콩고 강의 한 섬에 피난처를 마련했습니다. 		The chimpanzees and other animals are monitored by the organization's scientists, who provide them with food and medical care. The goal is to eventually release them back into the wild. 		침팬지와 다른 동물들은 그들에게 음식과 의료 서비스를 제공하는 헬프 콩고 단체의 과학자들에 의해 모니터링됩니다. 궁극적인 목표는 그들을 야생으로 다시 풀어주는 것입니다.

자동차 수리 시설에서 폐기물을 적절하게 취급 및 처분하는 것은 직원의 건강을 위해 중요할 뿐만 아니라 벌금이나 상당한 법적 합의를 피하기 위해서도 중요합니다. 또한 고객은 환경을 적극적으로 보호하고 지속 가능한 방식으로 운영하려는 노력을 기울이는 회사와 거래하고 싶어합니다. 그렇다면 이것을 할 수 있는 일곱 가지 방법은 무엇입니까? 1번: 중고 오일 재정제. 오래된 오일을 그냥 버리지 마십시오. 올바른 공정을 통해 오일을 완전히 재정제하여 품질이 저하되지 않고 무한정 재사용할 수 있습니다.

근처에 있던 바실은 비상 경보로 인해 잠에서 깨어났습니다. 화재로 인해 악취가 나는 가스 구름이 지역 전역으로 확산되었기 때문입니다. 지역 주민들은 집 밖으로 나가지 말고 모든 창문과 문을 닫으라는 경고를 받았습니다. 이 경고는 연기가 치명적이지 않다고 생각되는 오전 7 시경에 해제되었습니다. 문제가 되는 것은 공기가 아니라 오염된 물이며, 화재를 진압하는 데 사용된 물 때문에 재앙이 발생했습니다. 고농도의 독성 수은 화합물은 창고에 있는 해양 드레싱의 살균제로 사용되었으며, 형광 적색 염료 Rhodamine B로 표시되어 있었습니다. 	이것은 해양 드레싱의 살균제로 사용된 고농도의 독성 수은 화합물이 형광 적색 염료 Rhodamine B로 표시되어 있었기 때문입니다. 		The highly toxic mercury compounds were present as fungicides in sea dressings in the warehouse, and were marked with fluorescent red dye Rhodamine B. 		이것은 해양 드레싱의 살균제로 사용된 고농도의 독성 수은 화합물이 형광 적색 염료 Rhodamine B로 표시되어 있었기 때문입니다.

Transeuropa Festival은 격년으로 열리는 문화, 정치, 예술 행사/포럼/컨퍼런스입니다. 우리는 10년 동안 유럽 얼터너티브(European Alternative)라는 조직을 통해 이 행사를 주최해 왔습니다. 따라서 우리는 상당한 경험을 가지고 있습니다. 동시에 유목민적인 행사이기 때문에 항상 다른 도시에서 열립니다. 2년 전에는 유럽 연합 외부의 도시인 베오그라드에서 열렸습니다. 올해 2017년에는 여러 가지 이유로 마드리드에 오기를 원했습니다.

At the same time, it's an event that is nomadic, so it always takes place in a different city. The last time, two years ago, we were in Belgrade, so in a city outside of the European Union.

약 4억 5천만 년 전, 식물은 오늘날 우리가 알고 있는 식물로 진화하기 위해 바다에서 육지로 거대한 도약을 했습니다. 하지만 어떻게 살아남았을까요? 존 이네스 센터의 과학자들은 그 해답을 찾아냈을지도 모릅니다. 육상 식물은 토양으로부터 물과 영양분을 섭취함으로써 생존합니다. 이를 위해 그들은 미코리즈라고 불리는 토양 생활 균과 특별한 우정을 형성합니다. 미코리즈라는 이 균사는 토양 깊숙이 뻗어 영양분과 물을 식물로 끌어올립니다. 하지만 최초의 조류가 토양 위에 착륙했을 때, 어떻게 이러한 유익한 우정을 형성할 만큼 오래 살아남을 수 있었을까요? 	title: "최초의 조류가 토양 위에 착륙했을 때, 어떻게 이러한 유익한 우정을 형성할 만큼 오래 살아남을 수 있었을까요?"

Today we are exploring the city of Rotterdam. Rotterdam is a city located in the province of South Holland. It is a city that divides opinions because of its more modern and urban-looking architecture. Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed during World War II when the Germans attacked the city. Because of this, the city had to be rebuilt, resulting in it looking quite different from the other cities in the Netherlands. 		こんにちは、旅行 Vlogへようこそ。今日、ローテルダム市を探ります。ローテルダム市は南ホーランド省にある都市です。ローテルダム市は、建築が比較もダンダンしく都市的なものによって意見が分かれる都市です。ローテルダム市は、2次世界大戦中に、ドイツ人が攻撃し、都市の大部分が完全に破壊されました。このようなことによって、都市は重建され、荷兰の他の都市とは大きく違う面貌になりました。 		This is a travel vlog.

Lone Fox에서 저렴한 가구 DIY가 항상 인기가 있기 때문에, 저는 IKEA의 간단한 크레이트로부터 이 침대 옆 탁자를 만드는 방법을 여러분과 공유하고 싶었습니다. 이것은 Knagglig 크레이트이며, IKEA에서 $10 정도에 구입할 수 있습니다. 저는 지침에 따라 조립을 시작했습니다. 모든 요소를 함께 나사로 조여야 합니다. 모든 것이 나사로 조여지면 기본적인 나무 상자가 됩니다. 이제 나무 상자의 바닥에 다리를 추가하고 싶었기 때문에 공예품 가게에서 발견한 작은 나무 요리 접시 또는 작은 나무 트레이를 사용하여 바닥에서 들어 올렸습니다. 이들은 IKEA와 매우 비슷한 단순한 나무로 만들어졌으며 E6000으로 이들을 고정했습니다. 손톱 총을 사용하고 싶은 경우에도 사용할 수 있습니다. 작업이 끝나면 매우 간단하고 미니멀한 침대 옆 탁자가 완성됩니다. 	이 텍스트를 일본어로 번역해 주세요.		"Affordable furniture DIYs are always a hit here on Lone Fox, so I wanted to share with you guys how I created this nightstand from a simple crate from IKEA. So this is the Knagglig crate, which you can pick up for about $10 at IKEA. And I went ahead and I started off by just constructing it based off the instructions. You have to just screw all of the elements together. And once they are all screwed up, you have a basic wooden crate. Now on the bottom of the wooden crate, I wanted to add a leg, so I elevated it off the floor with these little wooden trinket dishes, or like little wooden trays that I found at the craft store as well. They are just a simple wood, very similar to the one from IKEA, and I just E6000ed these down. You could also use a nail gun if you'd like to. And once you are done, you have a very simple, minimal nightstand."

古銅色のオーネメントを作るために、単純にオーネメントの全体にrub and buffを塗ってしまうことだけできました。そして、当然、アルコールインクを使って古銅色にすることが必要です。そうして、初めてはジンジャーを使ってみました。我々のオーネメントに一滴のゴタを滴し、混合しました。そうして、あなたが好きの層数までこのプロセスを繰り返しし、実際のメタルのオーネメントと似た古銅色になるまで繰り返ししました。その後、もう少しブランシッシャーアンバースプレイペイントを使って、表面に塗ってしまうことだけできました。そうして、ベルオーネメントを作ったときと同じように、氧化されたように見せることができました。そうして、古銅色のボブルを作ったことがありました。非常に簡単しく、作りやすく、実際のメタルと同じように美しいものができました。 		To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of rub and buff onto the entire ornament there. And then of course, we have to get that antique look with the alcohol ink. So I went in with ginger first. I applied a droplet onto our ornament and just blended it out like so. And I just continued that process until I had as many layers as I liked, and it looked really antiqued in like an actual metal ornament. After that, I did go in with a little bit more of that burnished amber spray paint as well, and just applied that to the surface, to kind of give it that oxidized look like we did for the bell ornaments. And that is how I finished off these antique brass bobbles. Really simple and easy, but honestly, they look like real metal and they're beautiful. 		古銅色のオーネメントを作るために、単純にオーネメントの全体にrub and buffを塗ってしまうことだけできました。そして、当然、アルコールインクを使って古銅色にすることが必要です。そうして、初めてはジンジャーを使ってみました。我々のオーネメントに一滴のゴタを滴し、混合しました。そうして、あなたが好きの層数までこのプロセスを繰り返しし、実際のメタルのオーネメントと似た古銅色になるまで繰り返ししました。その後、もう少しブランシッシャーアンバースプレイペイントを使って、表面に塗ってしまうことだけできました。そうして、ベルオーネメントを作ったときと同じように、氧化されたように見せることができました。そうして、古銅色のボブルを作ったことがありました。非常に簡単しく、作りやすく、実際のメタルと同じように美しいものができました。 		To create the antique brass ornament, I just went in with a coat of rub and buff onto the entire

한 번의 클릭. 세상이 망가진 날의 동일한 스트림의 재방송이었습니다. 아빠는 내가 눈을 떼지 못할 때마다 채널을 끄곤 했습니다. 아빠가 내게 보여준 침울한 얼굴은 깊은 곳에서 비롯된 가슴 아픈 감정을 불러일으켰습니다. 나는 항상 그것이 재생될 때마다 기분이 나빠집니다. 하지만 그것은 많은 추억을 불러일으킵니다. 좋은 추억은 아니지만 말입니다. 한숨을 내쉬며 나는 천천히 일어났습니다. 마음을 다른 곳으로 돌려야 하니까요. 아빠의 슬픈 기분은 여전했습니다. 그리고 나는 정기적으로 아빠의 기분을 덜어주고 적어도 아빠에게 약간의 기쁨을 주려고 노력했습니다. 하지만 오늘; 나는 피곤합니다. 	이것은 자동으로 생성된 일본어 텍스트입니다. 해당 텍스트가 올바르게 번역되었는지 확인하거나 더 좋은 일본어 번역을 제안하려면 여기를 클릭하십시오. 자동 번역 표시네 아니오 도움을 주셔서 감사합니다! 	이것은 자동으로 생성된 일본어 텍스트입니다. 해당 텍스트가 올바르게 번역되었는지 확인하거나 더 좋은 일본어 번역을 제안하려면 여기를 클릭하십시오. 자동 번역 표시네 아니오 도움을 주셔서 감사합니다! 	이것은 자동으로 생성된 일본어 텍스트입니다. 해당 텍스트가 올바르게 번역되었는지 확인하거나 더 좋은 일본어 번역을 제안하려면 여기를 클릭하십시오. 자동 번역 표시네 아니오 도움을 주셔서 감사합니다! 	이것은 자동으로 생성된 일본어 텍스트입니다. 해당 텍스트가 올바르게 번역되었는지 확인하거나 더 좋은 일본어 번역을 제안하려면 여기를 클릭하십시오. 자동 번역 표시네 아니오 도움을 주셔서 감사합니다! 	이것은 자동으로 생성된 일본어 텍스트입니다. 해당 텍스트가 올바르게 번역되었는지 확인하거나 더 좋은 일본어 번역을 제안하려면 여기를 클릭하십시오. 자동 번역 표시네 아니오 도움을 주셔서 감사
나는 비교적 느린 걸음으로 문에 다가가 아빠에게 작게 소리친다. “저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요.” 아무 반응이 없다. 당연한 일이다. 아빠는 보통 내 말을 잘 듣는다. 문을 천천히 닫고 문이 완전히 닫히자 한숨이 새어 나온다. 거의 잊고 있다가 문에 있는 차가운 금속 스캐너에 손을 올린다. 이 아파트가 가지고 있는 것이 고급 기술이었지만, 대부분의 장소가 주목할 만한 기술을 가지고 있었기 때문에 오랜만에 다른 기술을 사용한 사람이 있었을 것이다. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder: 저는 잠깐 외출할 거예요. 저녁은 냉장고에 있어요. 	placeHolder:
寒冷な雨夜が続いた。パルトリクス市を探索し는 것은 탈출 또는 운 좋게 돌연변이에서 안전했던 사람들에게는 특권이었습니다. 도시의 밤은 수천 년 동안 남아있는 활기찬 별들로 아름답게 빛났습니다. 멀리 떨어진 하늘에서는 외로울 것입니다. パルトリクス는 좋은 곳이지만 사치스러운 삶의 장소라기보다는 감옥 같았습니다. 아파트, 주택 및 거주자를 수용 할 수있는 기타 건물로 가득 찼으며 대부분의 건물은 Ignniat 덕분에 수백 층 높이였습니다. 기술과 건축을 진정시키는 광물은 우리 삶의 기초를 확장 할 수있는 훌륭한 광물이었습니다. 그러나 대중의 지식은이 광물에 대해 많이 알지 못합니다. 주로 그것이 상당히 엄격하게 감춰져 있기 때문입니다. 	placePaltricus 	The cold, rainy night ensued my long overdue walk–exploring the city of Paltricus was a privilege to those who’d been safe from the mutation via escape, or pure luck. The city night was beautiful, illuminated with vibrant stars that remained for thousands of years. It must be lonely in the great distant sky. Paltricus was a nice place, but it felt more like a cage than a luxurious place of living. Filled to the brim with apartments, homes, and any other building able to hold occupants, most buildings were hundreds of stories tall; thanks to Ignniat.

혼란스러운 생각에서 벗어나 제가 좋아하는 카페로 향했습니다. 대부분의 사람들은 그 지역에서 바이러스에 감염된 사람들을 가리키는 사회의 소문이 퍼졌기 때문에 그곳을 피합니다. 이것은 정말로 저를 귀찮게하지 않았습니다. 저는 평생 동안 운이 좋았고 주인은 훌륭한 사람입니다. 밤늦게 이야기와 채팅을 나누는 대가로 무료 커피를 포기할 사람이 누가 있겠습니까?

店内に들어가자 커다란 종소리가 내 불편함을 없애 주었고 신선한 커피의 향기가 내 폐를 가득 채웠습니다. 이 가게의 주인인 안톤은 물론 카운터 뒤에 있었습니다. 몇몇 사람이 뒤쪽에 있는 것을 제외하고는 가게는 사실상 텅 비어 있었습니다. 카운터에 가까이 가자 긴 산책으로 지친 내 발이 의자 위에 늘어졌고 얼굴을 찌푸렸습니다. 고맙게도 안톤이 정기 주문을 가져오는 것이 보였습니다. “이리스씨, 긴 밤이죠?” 그의 쉰 목소리가 내 머릿속의 곡선 안에서 울렸습니다. “대충 그렇죠,” 나는 얕게 대답했습니다. 점점 더 피곤해지고 있었습니다. 	placeLilith 		"Hey Lilith, Long night?" his hoarse voice echoed within the fractals of my brain, "Something of the sort," I replied shallowly, more tired and tired by the second. 	placeLilith 		"이리스씨, 긴 밤이죠?" 그의 쉰 목소리가 내 머릿속의 곡선 안에서 울렸습니다.

피곤함을 달래기 위해, 나는 내 앞에 놓인 커피를 조금 마셨다. “그 목격 이후로 사업은 여전히 어렵죠..?” 나는 소리를 내지 않고 말했다. 안톤의 부대가 남긴 남은 손님들을 놀라게 하고 싶지 않았다. 그는 수건으로 유리를 닦으며 고개를 끄덕였다. 이 곳은 엄밀히 말하면 바이지만, 술을 마시러 온 적은 없었다. 뒤에서 약간의 중얼거림이 들렸지만, 오늘 밤 나와 안톤 사이의 대화는 상당히 짧게 끝났다. 그에게 작은 인사를 하고 나는 좀 더 에너지를 얻은 채 가게를 떠났다.

늦은 밤에 어두운 거리를 돌아다니는 것은 보통 최선의 선택은 아니었지만, 솔직히 답답한 아파트에 있는 것보다는 낫습니다. 대부분의 시간 동안 당신은 당신의 음악을 듣는 것보다 이웃들이 섹스를 하는 소리를 더 들을 수 있습니다. 짧고 숨이 찬 한숨과 함께, 나는 앞에 놓인 길을 바라보았습니다. 나는 알의 전당포 쪽으로 향할 것입니다. 단지 흥미로워 보이는 쓰레기를 취미로 찾는 곳입니다. 뒤에서 발자국 소리가 들리자 후회가 빠르게 몰려왔습니다. 아마도 나는 지나치게 생각하고 있는 것 같지만, 아무도 강도를 당하거나 구타당하기 위해 이 곳에 머물지 않습니다. 마피아와 갱 활동으로 유명한 곳이었습니다. 	 place. 	place.

나는 은밀하게 가게 뒤쪽으로 다가갔습니다. 금속 그레이트 너머에서 속삭이는 소리와 대화 소리가 들렸습니다. 그 그레이트를 몇 번 잡아 당기자 그것이 떨어졌습니다. 환기구 안으로 기어 들어가는 것이 현재로서는 가장 안전하고 조용한 선택이었습니다. 기어 들어가면서 이상한 옷을 입은 남자들 사이의 대화를 들을 수 있었습니다. 안에 있는 A.L.을 발견했습니다. A.L.은 쇠사슬에 묶여 있었습니다. 결국 잡힌 모양입니다. 		Note: "A.L." is a reference to a character in the original English text. It has been translated into Japanese as "A.L.". 		However, the translation may not be completely accurate due to the limitations of machine translation software. 		Stealthily I made my way towards the back of the store, murmurs and talking heard beyond a metal grate which took a few yanks to tear off. Climbing into the vent was the safest and quietest option for me right now; climbing my way through, I'd pick up on conversations and talks between strangely dressed men. I noticed A.L. inside, chained. Figures he'd get caught eventually. 		However, the translation may not be completely accurate due to the limitations of machine translation software.

ㅅ의 말이야, 나는 속으로 중얼거렸다. 그의 팔에 감긴 족쇄를 따는 시도를 하면서, 목소리가 우리의 위치를 알렸다. 희미한 발자국 소리가 점점 더 커졌다. “빨리! 환기구로 다시 들어가서 도망쳐, 다시는 오지 마. 만약 우리가 다시 만난다면, 이 도시가 아닐 거야.” 그는 서둘러 말했다. 패닉의 얼굴 표정은 내 신경을 전혀 도와주지 않았다. 그의 충고를 듣고 나는 환기구에서 나올 수밖에 없었다. 젠장, 앨. 환기구에서 나온 후 바로 달려갔다. 그런 소중한 친구를 잃는 것이 조금 아쉬웠다. 그들이 그를 다른 도시로 옮기는 걸까? 내 머릿속은 조금 산만했지만 대부분 화가 나서 슬펐다. 나는 외곽 도시에 대해 많은 연구를 했었고, 알카트라즈라고 불리는 감염된 사람들의 수도에 대해서도 말이다. 감염된 사람들이 감염된 땅과 연결된 땅을 모두 잘라냈다는 것을 생각하면 정말 비극이었다. 	 placeHolder: ㅅ의 말이야, 나는 속으로 중얼거렸다. 그의 팔에 감긴 족쇄를 따는 시도를 하면서, 목소리가 우리의 위치를 알렸다. 희미한 발자국 소리가 점점 더 커졌다. “빨리! 환기구로 다시 들어가서 도망쳐, 다시는 오지 마. 만약 우리가 다시 만난다면, 이 도시가 아닐 거야.” 그는 서둘러 말했다. 패닉의 얼굴 표정은 내 신경을 전혀 도와주지 않았다. 그의 충고를 듣고 나는 환기구에서 나올 수밖에 없었다. 젠장, 앨. 환기구에서 나온 후 바로 달려갔다. 그런 소중한 친구를 잃는 것이 조금 아쉬웠다. 그들이 그를 다른 도시로 옮기는 걸까? 내 머릿속은 조금 산만했지만 대부분 화가 나서 슬펐다. 나는 외곽 도시에 대해 많은 연구를 했었고, 외곽 도시에 대해서도 말이다. 감염된 사람들이 감염된
집에 가는 길은 조용했지만 너무 시끄러웠습니다. 내 머릿속을 감염시키는 생각들이 요란하게 울려 퍼졌고, 도움을 주지 못한 것에 대한 후회가 여러 번 스쳐 지나갔습니다. 마침내 집에 도착했을 때는 눈물을 흘릴 뻔했습니다. 구름에서 터져 나오는 소리 때문에 끔찍한 산책을 한 것 같았습니다. 때로는 어떤 사람이라도 겁을 먹을 정도로 천둥이 요란했습니다. 아버지는 이미 소파에 쓰러져 계셨고, 10~12년 된 오래된 영화의 재방송을 보고 계셨습니다. 한숨을 쉬며, 나는 조용히 내 방으로 돌아갔습니다. 침대에 눕자 나는 오래 눈을 뜨지 못했습니다. 잠이 몰려와 곧 잠에 빠져들었습니다. 		The walk home was quiet, but so loud. The thoughts infecting my brain were booming, and the regret of not having stayed to help flashed over multiple times. I finally arrived home, almost brought to tears by the dreadful walk in the burst of sounds from the clouds above, the thunderous booms were enough to frighten any person sometimes. Dad was already passed out on the couch, some rerun of an older movie, probably 10-12 years old; sighing, I quietly crept my way back to my room. Flopping in the bed, I wasn’t able to keep my eyes open for long. Before long, slumber crept up on me. 		집에 가는 길은 조용했지만 너무 시끄러웠습니다. 내 머릿속을 감염시키는 생각들이 요란하게 울려 퍼졌고, 도움을 주지 못한 것에 대한 후회가 여러 번 스쳐 지나갔습니다. 마침내 집에 도착했을 때는 눈물을 흘릴 뻔했습니다. 구름에서 터져 나오는 소리 때문에 끔찍한 산책을 한 것 같았습니다. 때로는 어떤 사람이라도 겁을 먹을 정도로 천둥이 요란했습니다. 아버지는 이미 소파에 쓰러져 계셨고, 10~12년 된 오래된 영화의 재방송을 보고 계셨습니다. 한숨을 쉬며, 나는 조용히 내 방으로 돌아갔습니다. 침대에 눕자 나는 오래 눈을 뜨지 못했습니다. 잠이 몰려와 곧 잠에 빠져들었습니다.

나는 감시 카메라를 내 휴대폰으로 옮겨 그것들을 유심히 지켜봤다. 아무 것도 없었다. 마치 그것들이 거기에 없었던 것처럼. 그것은 아무 의미가 없다. 보안이 철저한 카메라는 원격 접속도 가능했다. 어떻게……? 아아. 나는 화가 나서 서 있었다. 내 머릿속에서 몇 가지 생각을 지우기 위해 준비가 되어 있었다. 나는 미끄러지는 신발을 신고 열쇠를 들고 그쪽으로 걸어갔다. “곧 돌아올게, 아빠.”침묵. 어쨌든 그는 대답하지 않았다. 아마도 나보다 더 중요한 일을 하느라 바쁘니까. 	placeHolder: ARGH.

빠른 충격과 함께, 나는 아파트 밖으로 나가는 길에 전율이 내 척추를 타고 내려가는 것을 느꼈다. 이상하다. 그 느낌을 무시하고, 나는 조사를 위해 알의 곳으로 향하라고 나 자신을 촉구했지만, 내 다리는 안톤의 작은 바를 향해 움직였다. 그곳은 꽤 평온한 곳이었고, 나는 누군가와 이야기 할 필요가 있었다. 빚진 바텐더보다 더 나은 사람은 누구입니까? 		However, as I walked towards Anton's bar, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. 		그러나 내가 안톤의 바를 향해 걸어 갔을 때, 무언가가 잘못되었다는 느낌을 떨칠 수 없었습니다. 		I walked into Anton's bar and ordered a drink. The bartender looked at me quizzically, but didn't say anything. 		나는 안톤의 바에 들어가 술 한 잔을 주문했다. 바텐더는 나를 의아하게 쳐다 보았지만 아무 말도하지 않았다. 		As I sipped my drink, I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched. 		내가 마시는 동안, 나는 감시 당하고 있다고 느끼는 것을 도울 수 없었다. 		Suddenly, Anton walked up to me and asked if I wanted to talk. I hesitated for a moment before agreeing. 		갑자기 안톤이 내게로 걸어 와서 내가 이야기하고 싶은지 묻더군요. 나는 동의하기 전에 잠깐 망설였습니다. 		"Sure," I said. "What's on your mind?" 		"확실합니다."라고 말했습니다. "당신의 마음에 무엇입니까?" 		Anton took a deep breath before launching into his story. 		안톤은 그의 이야기를 시작하기 전에 깊은 숨을 쉬었습니다. 		He told me about his girlfriend, who had been acting strange lately. She would disappear for hours at a time, and when she came back, she would be distant and unresponsive. Anton was worried that something was wrong with her, but he didn't know what to do. 		그는 최근에 이상한 행동을하는 여자 친구에 대해 이야기했습니다. 그녀는 한 번에 몇 시간 동안 사라지고, 돌아 왔을 때, 그녀는 멀리있을 것이고 반응하지 않을 것입니다. 안톤은 그녀에게 무슨 일이 일어 났는지 걱정했지만, 무엇을해야할지 몰랐습니다. 		I listened intently as Anton spoke, and when he finished, I told him that I thought he should talk to the police.
不規則であるが、アントンの店は相当に忙しく、私は以前に見지 못했던 活動や新たな面孔で匆匆忙忙。アントンは定期的に僅一人の働き人であったので、私は私が相当にストレスを受けていることを知っていました。“バーキープさん、咖啡一杯してください。”私は的的に低い音調で言ったので、私が他人を困擾することを避けるために、他人を困擾することを避けるために、小さな笑声が私の嘴から逃げ出し、私が急速に回頭した後、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出されたために、そのために吐出された
작은 유니폼으로 갈아입은 후, 바에서 약간 도와주었습니다. 바 안에 있는 사람들의 끊임없는 유혹과 고양이 소리를 제외하면 꽤 쉬웠습니다. 하지만 솔직히 말해서 그렇게 귀찮게 생각하지 않았습니다. 이 교대 후에 안톤과 이야기하겠습니다. 나는 여전히 알을 내 마음에서 떨쳐 버려야합니다. 그러나 나는 여전히 그의 장소를 조사 할 것입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고...

テヌクは応じ지 않았다、他は ニシィとタサリンを向けて 날아가는 데 집중하느라 너무 바빴다、비록 다른 생물체가 그들을 쫓고 있었지만 말이다。カイエル은 어색하게 자신을 돌렸다、그래서 그는 괴물을 마주할 수 있었다。그것이 그들을 쫓고 있다는 사실은 카이エル의 눈에 좋은 소식이었다、그것은 그에게 조준하고 발사하기 쉬워졌기 때문이다。두 발의 총성이 그 생물체의 꼭대기 날개를 통과했고、그것은 고통에 비명을 지르며 나무 밑으로 사라졌다。그것이 여전히 그들을 쫓고 있는지 카이エル은 확실하지 않았다、하지만 그것은 확실히 그들을 따라올 수 없었을 것이다。 	placeHolder: テヌクは応じ지 않았다、他は ニシィとタサリンを向けて 날아가는 데 집중하느라 너무 바빴다、비록 다른 생물체가 그들을 쫓고 있었지만 말이다。カイエル은 어색하게 자신을 돌렸다、그래서 그는 괴물을 마주할 수 있었다。그것이 그들을 쫓고 있다는 사실은 카이エル의 눈에 좋은 소식이었다、그것은 그에게 조준하고 발사하기 쉬워졌기 때문이다。두 발의 총성이 그 생물체의 꼭대기 날개를 통과했고、그것은 고통에 비명을 지르며 나무 밑으로 사라졌다。그것이 여전히 그들을 쫓고 있는지 카이エル은 확실하지 않았다、하지만 그것은 확실히 그들을 따라올 수 없었을 것이다。 	A: テヌクは応じ지 않았다、他は ニシィとタサリンを向けて 날아が는 で集中し、忙しかった。もちろん、別の生物体が彼らを追いつけてきていた。カイエルは困惑して自分を回り、怪物と正面することができるようにしました。彼が彼らを追いつけてきていることは、カイエルの眼では良い消息だった。彼は彼に対して조準し、発射することがやることになりました。2発の弾丸が彼方の上翼を穿過し、彼方は痛みを感じて嚎くと、森の下に消えました。彼方が彼らを追いつけているのか、カイエルは確実ではなかった、でも彼方は確実に彼らを追いつけていなかった。 	Orig: Tenuk didn't respond, he was too busy concentrating on flying towards Nyssi and Thass
앞에서 Nyssi는 Thassalin이 주변을 휘저으며 검은 괴물을 화염 폭발로 공격하는 동안 목숨을 걸고 매달려 있었습니다. 그 생물은 분명히 부상을 입었지만 매우 화가 나서 물러서지 않는 것처럼 보였고 불덩이는 충분하지 않은 것처럼 보였습니다.

Nyssi는 산탄총을 들고 Thassalin의 옆에 서서 검은 괴물을 향해 발사했습니다. 산탄은 괴물의 몸에 맞았고 괴물은 뒤로 몇 걸음 물러났습니다. 그러나 그것은 오래 가지 않았습니다. 괴물은 다시 앞으로 나아가기 시작했고 Nyssi는 다시 한 번 발사했습니다. 산탄은 괴물의 몸에 맞았고 괴물은 뒤로 몇 걸음 물러났습니다. 그러나 그것은 오래 가지 않았습니다. 괴물은 다시 앞으로 나아가기 시작했고 Nyssi는 다시 한 번 발사했습니다. 산탄은 괴물의 몸에 맞았고 괴물은 뒤로 몇 걸음 물러났습니다. 그러나 그것은 오래 가지 않았습니다. 괴물은 다시 앞으로 나아가기 시작했고 Nyssi는 다시 한 번 발사했습니다. 산탄은 괴물의 몸에 맞았고 괴물은 뒤로 몇 걸음 물러났습니다. 그러나 그것은 오래 가지 않았습니다. 괴물은 다시 앞으로 나아가기 시작했고 Nyssi는 다시 한 번 발사했습니다. 산탄은 괴물의 몸에 맞았고 괴물은 뒤로 몇 걸음 물러났습니다. 그러나 그것은 오래 가지 않았습니다. 괴물은 다시 앞으로 나아가기 시작했고 Nyssi는 다시 한 번 발사했습니다. 산탄은 괴물의 몸에

한 번의 탭 소리가 내부에서 들려왔다. 예, 그것은 말하는 것 같았다. 아이보리는 추위와 소리 때문에 몸을 떨었다. 아이보리는 몇 년 동안 그곳에 들어갔던 적이 있음에도 불구하고 아무도 없는 방에서 소리가 들리는 것이 이상하게 느껴졌다.

“들어가 볼게요.” 아이보리가 말하고 천천히 문을 열었습니다. 그들이 방에서 본 광경은 평범한 사람들의 기준에 의하면 이례적이었지만 뜻밖의 일은 아니었습니다. 종이가 여기저기 널려 있었고 책들이 흩어져 있었으며 책상은 부서져 있었고 여러 개의 얼음 조각이 흩어져 있었습니다. 창문은 없었고 빛도 거의 들어오지 않았습니다. 그 방은 궁전의 다른 방보다 더 춥습니다(이것은 많은 것을 말해 줍니다). 그 방은 마치 눈보라가 불어와 모든 것을 휩쓸어 버린 것처럼 보였습니다. 	"I'm coming in." Ivory said, slowly opening the door. The sight they saw in the room was unusual , by normal people's standards , but not unexpected. Papers were everywhere. Books were scattered about, the desk was broken, and there were multiple ice sculptures scattered about. There were no windows and little to no light. It was also colder than the rest of the palace (which was saying a lot). The room looked like a snowstorm blew it all out of place. 	"私は入ってみる。" アイボリーが言って、門を慢走して開けました。その房内にある景象は、普通の人たちの標準では異常なものであったが、意外ではありません。紙が墊てているところもあり、図書が散られているところもあり、椅子が壊れているところもあり、氷の雕塑が散られているところもありました。窓はありませんから、光も少し入っていません。その房間は、宮殿の他の房間よりも寒いでありました（このことは、多くのことを伝えています）。その房間は、雪嵐が吹ってきて全てを弾けてしまったように見えました。" 	"私は入ってみる。" Ivory said, slowly opening the door.

그들은 또한 공주의 하인으로 일하도록 강요당했습니다. 그들은 친구도 사귈 수 있었기 때문에 크게 신경 쓰지 않았습니다. 		However, as time went on, they became more and more unhappy with their situation. They missed their families and friends, and they longed to be free. 		그러나 시간이 지남에 따라 그들은 점점 더 불행해졌습니다. 그들은 가족과 친구를 그리워했고, 자유롭기를 갈망했습니다. 		Finally, they managed to escape and return to their homeland. They were hailed as heroes upon their return. 		마침내 그들은 탈출하여 고국으로 돌아갈 수 있었습니다. 그들이 돌아왔을 때, 그들은 영웅으로 환영받았습니다. 		However, not everyone was happy with their return. The princess was furious and demanded that they be punished. She accused them of stealing her jewelry and other valuables. 		그러나 모든 사람들이 그들의 귀환을 기뻐한 것은 아니었습니다. 공주는 화가 나서 그들을 처벌해야 한다고 주장했습니다. 그녀는 그들이 그녀의 보석과 기타 귀중품을 훔쳤다고 비난했습니다. 		The two men were put on trial and found guilty. They were sentenced to death by hanging. 		두 남자는 재판을 받았고 유죄 판결을 받았습니다. 그들은 교수형에 처해졌습니다.

They felt that they were being punished for something they did not do. 		공주는 재판 결과에 만족했지만, 두 남자는 그렇지 않았습니다. 그들은 자신들이 한 일이 아닌 것에 대해 처벌을 받고 있다고 느꼈습니다. 		The two men were hanged, and their bodies were thrown into the river. The princess watched from the balcony of her palace, feeling a sense of satisfaction. 		두 남자는 교수형에 처해졌고, 그들의 시신은 강에 던져졌습니다. 공주는 그녀의 궁전의 발코니에서 만족감을 느끼며 지켜보았습니다.

그들은 프린세스가 마침내 안락 지대에서 벗어나 페인트와 같은 자신의 힘을 벗어난 것을 요구하고 있다는 사실에 안도하며 방을 나왔습니다. 		However, as the days went by, the princess's behavior became more and more erratic. 		그러나 시간이 지남에 따라 프린세스의 행동은 점점 더 불규칙해졌습니다. 		She would spend hours staring at the wall, muttering to herself. 		그녀는 몇 시간 동안 벽을 응시하며 혼잣말을 하곤 했습니다. 		Sometimes she would scream and throw things. 		때때로 그녀는 소리를 지르며 물건을 던지곤 했습니다. 		It was clear that something was seriously wrong with the princess. 		프린세스에게 뭔가 심각한 문제가 있다는 것은 명백했습니다. 		They tried everything they could think of to help her. 		그들은 그녀를 돕기 위해 생각할 수 있는 모든 것을 시도했습니다. 		But nothing seemed to work. 		그러나 아무 것도 효과가 없는 것 같았습니다. 		Finally, they decided to take her to a specialist. 		마침내 그들은 그녀를 전문의에게 데려가기로 결정했습니다. 		The specialist was able to diagnose the princess with severe depression. 		그 전문의는 공주에게 심각한 우울증이 있다고 진단할 수 있었습니다. 		They started her on medication and therapy, and slowly but surely, she began to improve. 		그들은 그녀에게 약물 치료와 치료를 시작했고, 천천히 그러나 확실하게, 그녀는 나아지기 시작했습니다. 		It took a long time, but eventually, the princess was able to return to her normal life. 		오랜 시간이 걸렸지만, 결국 공주는 정상적인 삶으로 돌아올 수 있었습니다. 		She was still a little different, but she was happy and healthy, and that was all that mattered. 		그녀는 여전히 조금 달랐지만, 그녀는 행복하고 건강했고, 그것이 중요한 전부였습니다. 		The experience taught them that mental health is just as important as physical health, and that there is no shame in seeking help when you need it. 		그 경험은 그들에게 정신 건강이 육체 건강만큼이나 중요하고, 도움이 필요할 때 도움을 청하는 것이 부끄러운 일이 아니라는 것을 가르쳐 주었습니다. 		It was a long and difficult road, but in the end, it was worth it. 		그것은 길고 어려운 길이었지만, 결국에는 그만한 가치가 있었습니다. 		The experience taught them that

“全部の坦克が出発し고 있습니다” 指挥官は冷静하지만 명확한 음성으로 헤드셋을 통해 말문을 열었습니다. 소대의 탱크와 스트라이커의 엔진이 시동을 걸고 앞으로 움직이기 시작했습니다. 크로노스 코렌은 브레이크가 풀리면서 흔들렸고 대열에 합류했습니다. 탱크는 이타니아 평원을 가로질러 움직이면서 쐐기 모양을 만들었습니다. 겨울 폭풍으로 인해 습지와 숲이 얼어붙었지만 진흙은 항상 남아 있었습니다. 		"All tanks were moving out" the commander started calmly but clearly into his headset. The engines of a platoon of tanks and Strykers roared to life as they started moving forward. The Kronos Cohren was jolted as its break released and moved forward, getting into formation. The tanks took up a wedge formation as they moved across the Itania plains. The winter storms had frozen over the wetlands and forests, but the mud always remained.

“俘虏인 듯합니다” 코렌은 두 개의 센티넬이 재와 연기의 구름 속으로 사라지자 추측했습니다. 능선에서 고함소리와 총성이 울려 퍼졌지만 곧 멈추었습니다. 잠시 후 두 개의 센티넬이 뒤에서 누군가를 끌고 돌아왔습니다. 그들의 부츠는 뒤를 따랐습니다. 그들이 소대의 안전에 도달했을 때 그들은 인물을 땅에 던졌습니다. 그는 진흙과 눈에 딱딱하게 떨어졌습니다. 		"Looks like capture" Cohren guessed as the two Sentinels disappeared into the cloud of ash and smoke. Shouting and gunshots echoed from the ridge, but quickly ceased. A moment later the two sentinels marched back, pulling someone behind them, their boots dragging behind them. When they reached the safety of the platoon they threw the figure to the ground, he grunted in pain as they landed hard in the mud and snow.
